I referenced the class activites a lot for help in setting up my code, helping guide me to the next step when stuck, etc. Those included "crowdfunding_cleaning_solution", "binning_solution", "search_for_the_worst_solution", "census_merging_solution", and "data_functions_solution".

Additionally, Xpert AI was a huge help for me on this challenge. There were several troubleshooting tips I received this way from things like when I kept getting two $ for my per_student_budget and various other bugs.

Finally, our TA Arda was a big help in office hours with a couple of issues I was having. During this time, classmate Yessmelin helped with the "observed=False" solution to the error from the provided code. Arda advised us that commenting this out in the code would be ok to explain things.
